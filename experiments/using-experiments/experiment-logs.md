# Experiment Logs

Log streaming is available in both the Web UI and CLI.  It is also possible to stream logs using the SDK.  

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Web UI" %}
Navigate to a Job run part of an Experiment to view its logs.  These logs are streamed in realtime while the Experiment runs.  There are a few options such as Search, View all Logs, and Download Logs available on the page.

You can stream logs while the Experiment is running or after it has stopped.‌

gradient experiments logs --experimentId <id>
```

{% tab title="SDK" %}
While using the SDK, you can print the logs of an Experiment.

```python
#create a log stream & print all logs for the duration of experiment
log_stream = experiment_client.yield_logs(experiment_id)
print("Streaming logs of experiment")
try:
    while True:
        print(log_stream.send(None))
except:
    print("done streaming logs")
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
