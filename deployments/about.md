  for any trained model. These allow ML practitioners to quickly validate
  “end-to-end” services, from R&D to production.

# About

## Overview

Deploy any model as a high-performance, low-latency micro-service with a RESTful API. Easily monitor, scale, and version deployments.  Deployments take a trained model and expose them as a persistent service at a known, secure URL endpoint.

## Current Capabilities

* Out-of-the-box integration with TensorFlow, but can be easily extended to serve other types of models and data. \(ONNX and Custom model types coming soon.\)
* A variety of GPU & CPU types to deploy on
* Per second pay-as-you-go billing
* Multi-instance deployments with automatic load balancing
* A dedicated, secure endpoint URL per deployment
* Accessible via the Gradient CLI, Web UI or API, or from your own custom applications
