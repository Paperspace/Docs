# Create a Notebook

## Choose your Base Container

Notebooks can be created by clicking _Create Notebook_ button on the Notebooks tab.  There are three types of base containers:

### Popular Containers \(Basic\)

These are the templates that are most popular on Gradient.  They include the most common ML frameworks and libraries.  [Click here](notebook-containers/) to discover which Notebook Base Container will best suit your use case, then choose it from the options below:

## Choose the instance type

This is infrastructure that your notebook will run on. Our hardware is configured to work with the tools and packages in each of the provided containers.

## Optional Settings:

### Name your Notebook

Provide a friendly name for your Notebook in the text field

### Auto-shutdown

If you have a [Gradient subscription](https://gradient.paperspace.com/pricing), you will have the ability to set a custom auto-shutdown interval. 

If you do not have a Gradient subscription, your notebook will default to an auto-shutdown interval of 12 hours, to help avoid unexpected runtime charges. Once created, you can stop, start, fork, and swap out the instance type anytime. 

## Click Create

That's it! Your Notebook will start once it has been created. 🚀
