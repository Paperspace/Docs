  discover machine learning projects on the Gradient platform. Currently they
  support sharing public notebooks.

# Public Profiles

{% hint style="success" %}
Gradient Public Profiles are still in beta. The look and feel will change during this development phase. We welcome all feature requests and bug reports to continue to make this feature more powerful and rich.
{% endhint %}

## Creating your public profile

To create your public profile, visit the Console and hover over your user/team icon at the top-right.

There, click `Profile` in the dropdown menu. This will take you to your current public profile. By default, your user or team handle is set to your auto-generated internal private workspace or team id (e.g. `t98sga1`).

Click `Edit Profile` to set your user or team handle, public profile description, and more.

Your user/team handle follows a GitHub-style convention and will be accessible at **https://www.paperspace.com/{your\_handle}**

## **Sharing public notebooks**

[Public notebooks](broken-reference) are a new feature in Gradient.  They allow you to run a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) and easily share it with others. A Gradient Notebook is actually an entire self-contained container with all libraries, dependencies, and files contained within it. This means that you can easily create complex ML applications without worrying about having others run install scripts, run into dependency management issues, and more.

Once a notebook is made `Public` it will show up under your public profile for others to view and fork into their own account.&#x20;

## Roadmap

Gradient Public profiles are still very much a work-in-progress. Notebooks are the first feature to be enabled for showing up on profiles, but soon we will be adding [Projects](../../get-started/managing-projects/), [Models](../../data/models/create-a-model/), [Datasets](../../data/data-overview/persistent-storage.md), and more.

As always, we are eager to hear your feedback. Now go claim your user/team handle â€“ we are excited to see what you build!  ðŸ™Œ
