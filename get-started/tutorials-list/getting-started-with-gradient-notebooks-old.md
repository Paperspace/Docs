# Getting Started: Launch a Notebook

## **Key Concepts**

**Supported languages & file types**

Any Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) is supported natively.   You can also treat a Notebook as a full IDE and both write and execute code written in other languages such as Python.  &#x20;

#### Compute options

Gradient provides one-click access to Jupyter Notebooks that run on a variety of [instance types](../../more/instance-types/), including our [free tier](../../more/instance-types/free-instances.md), as well your own [compute clusters](../../gradient-private-cloud/about/setup/self-hosted-clusters/) e.g. your AWS account.&#x20;

#### Runtime&#x20;

Notebooks run within a Docker container so they are lightweight, portable, and easy to work with. You can start your Notebook with one of our [pre-configured templates](../../explore-train-deploy/notebooks/create-a-notebook/notebook-containers/) or use a custom docker image.&#x20;

Your runtime behaves like a traditional operating system: You can download files and install and run any package with standard tools available in Linux e.g. `wget`, `pip`, etc. from within the provided terminal or within a Jupyter cell.  Any changes to your environment are persisted across multiple sessions. &#x20;

#### Workspace (optional)

When you launch a Notebook, you can provide a workspace which is a source of notebook (`.ipynb`) or other files that will be downloaded and added to your Notebook instance when it starts.  Common workspace sources include GitHub repos or individual files stored on GitHub.

#### Storage

Gradient provides a [persistent storage directory](../../explore-train-deploy/notebooks/create-a-notebook/notebooks-storage.md) which is automatically mounted at `/storage`.  You can use this directory to store any files.&#x20;

## Launching a Notebook Instance

Open the **Notebooks** tab to create a new notebook. After naming your notebook, the next step is to choose a pre-configured template or custom container. We'll select **PyTorch **which includes the PyTorch framework and the necessary NVIDIA libraries to enable GPU support. You can learn about using custom containers [here](../../explore-train-deploy/notebooks/create-a-notebook/notebook-containers/#custom-containers).

In the next step, choose the machine type. Here you can choose from the managed service or your [private cluster](../../gradient-private-cloud/about/) instances if you have created a private cluster. Select the **Free GPU** machine to access free GPU instances. On this step, you can also select auto-shutdown which is especially useful when using paid instances.  Finally, you can toggle the Notebook to be [public](../../explore-train-deploy/notebooks/create-a-notebook/public-notebooks.md) or private.  &#x20;

The last (optional) step is to customize the **Workspace** and the **Container**.  The Workspace option provides the ability to pull down files into the notebook when it's created.  A common example is to pull a GitHub repository (see image below).  The [container option ](../../explore-train-deploy/notebooks/create-a-notebook/notebook-containers/#custom-containers)allows you to provide a custom Docker image from a public or private container registry. &#x20;

The final step is to click **start notebook**.

## The Notebook interface

On the **files** tab, you can create, rename, and delete files and folders.  Once your Notebook is online, you can edit and run notebook or other code files.&#x20;

Jupyter operations, such as adding and removing cells, are fully supported.  You can right-click on cells to view additional options.

Standard code files are also supported with full syntax highlighting.
