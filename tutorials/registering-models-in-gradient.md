# Registering Models in Gradient

## **Objectives**

* Understand the workflow involved in registering models
* Passing environment variables through Gradient CLI
* Persisting model files in Gradient Storage
* Registering Tensorflow Models in Gradient 

## **Introduction**

Experiments in Gradient can generate machine learning models, which can be interpreted and stored in your Project's Models list. This list holds references to the model and checkpoint files generated during the training period as well as summary metrics associated with the model's performance, such as accuracy and loss.

In this tutorial, we will create an experiment to generate a Keras model based on the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist). We will learn techniques such as passing environment variables to jobs, specifying the right container image, and mentioning the path to store the model artifacts.

The model is trained in Keras but it is finally exported as a TensorFlow model through `tf.saved_model.simple_save`method. This approach seralizes Keras session into a TensorFlow `.pb` file.

Start by cloning the repo [https://github.com/janakiramm/fashionmnist](https://github.com/janakiramm/fashionmnist) that contains the code for training and inferencing the model.

## Create a Project for Fashion MNIST

We will start by creating a project that can contain multiple experiments we may run during the training.

```text
gradient projects create --name Fashion
```

## Create an Experiment to Train the Model 

We will now start an experiment within the project created above. Make a note of the project id before proceeding further.

Switch to the train directory of the cloned Github repo.

```text
cd train
```

```text
gradient experiments run singlenode \
  --name fmnist \
  --projectId prioax2c4 \
  --experimentEnv "{\"EPOCHS\":5}" \
  --container tensorflow/tensorflow:1.9.0-gpu \
  --machineType K80 \
  --command "python train.py --modelPath /storage/model --version 1" \
  --modelType Tensorflow \
  --modelPath "/storage/model"
```

The above command has multiple switches that are important to the job. Letâ€™s understand each of them.

The `singlenode` parameter runs the job on a single host.

`--name` assigns a friendly name to the experiment.

`--projectId` associates the experiment with an existing project.

`--experimentEnv` passes environment variables to the script. In our code, we decide the number of epochs based on the value defined in the EPOCHS environment variable.

`--container` parameter points the job to a container image used for the training job. Notice that we are passing an image that can advantage of a GPU-based machine.

`--machineType` schedules the job in one of the preferred instances. In our case, we are using K80 machine type that comes with an NVIDIA K80 GPU. Since the container and machine type are based on GPU, the job exploits the CUDA and cuDNN for accelerated training.

`--command` instructs the job to execute the script along with the passed parameters. The script expects the path to store the final model artifacts along with the version number. Since we are using a sub-directory under the `/storage` directory, the files stored are persisted across experiments. The model files stored here are used to register the TensorFlow model with Gradient. Feel free to explore [train.py](https://github.com/janakiramm/fashionmnist/blob/master/train/train.py) to understand how environment variables and command line parameters can be used to target Gradient specific features while keeping the code independent.

`--modelType Tensorflow`switch indicates that the job generates a valid TensorFlow model which can be managed and served by Gradient. Frameworks other than TensorFlow will be supported in the near future, such as `ONNX` and `Custom`.

`--modelPath` tells Gradient where to look for the model artifacts. This is typically `/artifacts` or `/storage` location. We are passing `/storage/model` directory which was used within the code.

Within a few seconds of running the command, you should see the logs displayed on the screen.

## Verifying the Creation of Model

We can check if the output of the job is registered as a valid TensorFlow model with the following command.

```text
gradient models list
```

`+------+-----------------+------------+------------+----------------+   
| Name | ID              | Model Type | Project ID | Experiment ID  |   
+------+-----------------+------------+------------+----------------+   
| None | mosdnkkv1o1xuem | Tensorflow | prioax2c4  | e720893n7f5vx  |   
+------+-----------------+------------+------------+----------------+`

The project id `prioax2c4` and experiment id `e720893n7f5vx` confirm that it is the model associated with the latest experiment.

You can also visit the Models section of Gradient UI to see a list of registered models.

## Summary 

After registering the model, we can turn that into a deployment to perform inferencing.
