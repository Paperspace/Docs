# Creating a Team

To access many advanced features in Gradient, you will need to create a team workspace if you don't already have one.

From the home console select the **Team** menu:

Give your new team a **Name**:

That's it! You should now have a new team available in the Gradient console. The next step is to invite teammates to the workspace to collaborate -- or else to begin using Team features like Clusters and Datasets.
