# Metrics Overview

Experiments and Deployments on Gradient can record metrics which are available both in realtime or after they are finished running. Gradient will display these metrics in the web UI and they can also be queried or streamed in the CLI.

We log hardware metrics.


## System metrics

All Gradient workloads like Experiments and Deployments monitor and track CPU, Memory, and Network. If the machine is equipped with a GPU, this will be tracked as well.
