## Set Up GradientCI

### Creating a GradientCI Project via the Paperspace Console

To create a Gradient Project with continuous integration powered by GradientCI and GitHub:

1. Install the [GradientCI](https://github.com/apps/gradientci) GitHub app on your repository. \(GitHub Admin privilege is required.\)
2. Navigate to the [Projects page](https://www.paperspace.com/console/projects).
3. Click Create Project.
4. Select GitHub Project.
5. Grant Paperspace access to your GitHub repos via OAuth.
6. Confirm a repo with GradientCI installed for your new Gradient° Project.

### Configure GradientCI Settings

To set up GradientCI, our continuous integration service, include a directory in your GitHub repository called `.ps_project` with a configuration file `config.yaml`, example below.

### Building Branches and Tags

GradientCI supports building and sourcing project configuration from arbitrary branches or tags. By default we only build configuration sourced from your default branch \(typically `master`\). You can [change your repositories default branch from within Github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-the-default-branch), if you only need the configuration from one branch. You can relax or tighten this rule by selecting "All" or "None" from the "Build Branches" dropdown in the project settings pane of the Gradient console. If you would like to build any tags or a subset of branches that are not the default branch, select "All" from this menu and provide filters in your `config.yaml`. To list the specific patterns of tags and branches to build, see [branch and tag filters](gradientci.md#filtering-branches-and-tags).

You may additionally disable the builds of pull requests, enabled by default. Or enable builds of pull requests that originate from forked repositories, disabled by default to prevent unauthorized use of Gradient resources. Each of these options will allow configuration to be sourced from the relevant Git branch.

#### Template

```yaml
# .ps_project/config.yaml:

version: 1

project: "project-handle"
experiment: "experiment-name" #[optional, default:<repo name>]
type: "experiment-type" #[single|multi-grpc|multi-mpi]
ports: "5000" #[optional, default:5000]

paths: #[optional]
  workdir: "/path/to/workdir"
  artifacts: "/path/to/artifacts"
model: #[optional, but required for model parsing and model deployments]
  type: "model-type" #[required for model, one of: Tensorflow|ONNX|Custom]
  path: "/path/to/model"

worker:
  container: "tensorflow/tensorflow:1.8.0-gpu"
  command: "nvidia-smi"
  machine-type: "K80"
  count: 1 #[required for multi-node]
parameter-server: #[required for multi-node]
  container: "tensorflow/tensorflow:1.8.0-gpu"
  command: "nvidia-smi"
  machine-type: "K80"
  count: 1
filters:
  branches:
    ignore: irrelevant-branch
  tags:
    only:
      - v.*

checks: #[optional]
  tensorflow:loss:
    target: "0.0..0.5"
    aggregate: "mean"
  defaults: #[optional]
    precision: 3
```

## Filtering Branches and Tags

By default GradientCI will only build the default branch and no tags. If you would like to build additional non-pull request branches or tags you must select "All" from the "Build Branches" project configuration dropdown. This will build all branches and no tags. Once that is complete you can filter additional branches in your `config.yaml` by providing a `filters` section. You can place the keys `branches` or `tags` to apply filters to the default. Under each key you can provide `only` or `ignore` fields, but not both, containing a [Posix compatible regex](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Regular_Expressions/POSIX_Basic_Regular_Expressions) or array of regex to match on. Branches or tags filtered by an `only` key must match one or more of the regex provided. Branches or tags filtered by an `ignore` key will be skipped if they match one or more of the regex provided.

## Metrics Checks

The GradientCI service can help you from degrading your model. When you run an experiment based on a code change, GradientCI can automatically check properties of the experiment and forward those results to GitHub. GitHub can use these statuses to prevent pull requests merges that degrade your model. GradientCI will automatically report whether the experiment ran without error or which checks failed if there was an error. You may configure additional checks for metrics that are generated by your experiment under the `checks` key in your `config.yaml`. Currently, we only support scalar metrics coming from TensorFlow generated summaries.

In addition to the status checks, GradientCI writes a detailed summary of the experiment to a comment on the pull request so you have your critical data at a glance while reviewing code.

### Configuration

For best results, especially on repositories with many contributors, we recommend configuring GitHub branch protections to prevent accidental merges of unintended pull requests. After your first build, statuses for the metrics will be reported back and you can make passing statuses required for the merge of your pull request. To do this follow [GitHub's documentation.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-protected-branches)

```yaml
# ...
checks:
  <identifier>:
    target: <range> #[required]
    aggregate: mean #[required]
    round: down #[optional, default: down, up|down]
    precision: 2 #[optional, default: 2]
    only-pulls: false #[optional, default: false]
    if-not-found: failure #[optional, default: "failure", success|failure]
    comment-on-pr: true #[optional, default: true]
  defaults:
    round: down #[optional, default: down, up|down]
    precision: 2 #[optional, default: 2]
    only-pulls: false #[optional, default: false]
    if-not-found: failure #[optional, default: "failure", success|failure]
    comment-on-pr: true #[optional, default: true]
```

#### `<identifier>`s:

* `<identifiers>` are split into two parts: 1. the source of the metric and 2. the name of the metric, e.g. `tensorflow:loss`.
  * Currently the only supported source is `tensorflow:`
* These `<identifiers>` are case-_sensitive_
* `“defaults”`: reserved for defaults to set for the `<identifiers>`. Any of the above keys are valid within this block and will set the default behavior for all other `<identifier>` blocks. If `round` is set to `down` all other metrics will be evaluated using the round down behavior. If an `<identifier>` has a key specified underneath it it will override the value in the `defaults` block. For instance, `round: up` under `tensorflow:loss` will override the `round: down` behavior in the `defaults` block.

#### `<range>`

Ranges can appear in the following forms:

1. `<number>` or `<number>..` this form allows you to specify that the metric must be greater than `<number>`.
2. `..<number>` this form allows you to specify that the metric must be less than `<number>`.
3. `<left>..<right>` this form allows you to specify that the metric must be less than `<left>` but greater than `<right>`.

Note these numbers are parsed as floats and relying on precise equality with the ends of the range is not recommended.

#### Required Properties

* `target`: this is a `<range>` for the metric to appear in
* `aggregate`: this is the aggregating function to evaluate the metric by.
  * Currently this is only supported for the aggregates automatically generated by tensorflow, these values are:
    * `mean`
    * `stddev`
    * `max`
    * `min`
    * `var`
    * `median`

#### Optional Properties

* `precision`: how many decimal places to keep \(default 2\)
* `round`: specifies rounding behavior \(default “down”\)
* `only-pulls`: only perform this check on pull requests
* `if-not-found`: return a default status if job has no data for `<identifier>`, defaults to “failure”
* `comment-on-pr`: include this metric in a summary content if the metrics were generated from a pull-request

## Models

To store model information in the Model Repository, add model properties to your configuration file.

* **model.type**: defines the type of model that is being generated by the experiment.  Model type must be one of `Tensorflow`, `ONNX`, or `Custom`
* **model.path**: defines where in the context of the experiment the model checkpoint files are being stored.

```yaml
model:
  type: "Tensorflow"
  path: "/path/to/model"
```

* For more information see: [Create a Model](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/models/model-types)

## Dockerfiles

To use dockerfiles for experiment containers, the following configurations are available:

* **worker.dockerfile.use**: **true/false** indicates whether a supplied dockerfile should be used for worker nodes.
* **worker.dockerfile.path**: defines the relative path of the dockerfile for worker nodes. If no value is provided \(and dockerfile.use is set to true\) the assumed location is "./Dockerfile"
* **parameter-server.dockerfile.use**: **true/false** indicates whether a supplied dockerfile should be used for multinode configuration parameter servers.
* **parameter-server.dockerfile.path**: defines the relative path of the dockerfile for multinode configuration parameter servers. If no value is provided and dockerfile.use is set to true, the assumed location is "./Dockerfile"

```yaml
worker:
  [...]
