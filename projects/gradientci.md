## Set Up GradientCI

### Creating a GradientCI Project via the Paperspace Console

To create a Gradient Project with continuous integration powered by GradientCI and GitHub:

1. Install the [GradientCI](https://github.com/apps/gradientci) GitHub app on your repository. \(GitHub Admin privilege is required.\)
2. Navigate to the [Projects page](https://www.paperspace.com/console/projects).
3. Click Create Project.
4. Select GitHub Project.
5. Grant Paperspace access to your GitHub repos via OAuth.
6. Confirm a repo with GradientCI installed for your new Gradient° Project.

### Configure GradientCI Settings

To set up GradientCI, our continuous integration service, include a directory in your GitHub repository called `.ps_project` with a configuration file `config.yaml`.
This file *must* exist on your default branch (typically `master`) in GitHub.
We do not yet read the configuration from pull-requests or alternative branches.

#### Template

```yaml
# .ps_project/config.yaml:

version: 0

project: "project-handle"
experiment: "experiment-name" # [optional, default:<repo name>]
type: "experiment-type" # [single|multi-grpc|multi-mpi]
ports: "5000" # [optional, default:5000]
paths: # [optional]
  workdir: "/path/to/workdir"
  artifacts: "/path/to/artifacts"
worker:
  container: "tensorflow/tensorflow:1.8.0-gpu"
  command: "nvidia-smi"
  machine-type: "K80"
  count: 1 # [required for multi-node]
parameter-server: # [required for multi-node]
  container: "tensorflow/tensorflow:1.8.0-gpu"
  command: "nvidia-smi"
  machine-type: "K80"
  count: 1
checks: # [optional]
  tensorflow:loss:
    target: 0.0..0.5
    aggregate: "mean"
  defaults: # [optional]
    precision: 3
```

#### Examples with only required fields

Single-node example

```yaml
version: 0

type: "single"
worker:
  container: "tensorflow/tensorflow:1.8.0-gpu"
  command: "nvidia-smi"
  machine-type: "K80"
```

Multinode example

```yaml
version: 0

type: "multi-grpc"
worker:
  container: "tensorflow/tensorflow:1.8.0-gpu"
  command: "nvidia-smi"
  machine-type: "K80"
  count: 2
parameter-server:
  container: "tensorflow/tensorflow:1.8.0-gpu"
  command: "nvidia-smi"
  machine-type: "K80"
  count: 1
```

  artifacts: "/var/ml/artifacts"
worker:
  container: "tensorflow/tensorflow:1.8.0-gpu"

```

### Metrics Checks

Our GradientCI service can help you from degrading your model.
When we run an experiment based on a code change, we can check properties of the experiment and forward those results to GitHub.
GitHub uses these statuses to prevent pull requests that degrade your model from merging.
We will automatically report whether the experiment ran without error as the status `ci/gradient`.
You may configure additional checks for metrics that are generated by your experiment under the `checks` key in your `config.yaml`.
Currently, we only support scalar metrics coming from TensorFlow generated summaries.

```yaml
# ...
checks:
  <identifier>:
    target: <range> #[required]
    aggregate: mean #[required]
    round: down #[ optional, default: down, up|down]
    precision: 2 #[ optional, default: 2]
    only-pulls: false #[ optional, default: false]
    if-not-found: failure #[ optional, default: "failure", success|failure]
    comment-on-pr: true #[optional, default: true]
  defaults:
    round: down #[ optional, default: down, up|down]
    precision: 2 #[ optional, default: 2]
    only-pulls: false #[ optional, default: false]
    if-not-found: failure #[ optional, default: "failure", success|failure]
    comment-on-pr: true #[optional, default: true]
```

### `<identifier>`s:

* `<identifiers>` are split into two parts: 1. the source of the metric and 2. the name of the metric, e.g. `tensorflow:loss`.
  * Currently the only supported source is `tensorflow:`
* These `<identifiers>` are case-*sensitive*
* “defaults”: reserved for defaults to set for the `<identifiers>`.
Any of the above keys are valid within this block and will set the default behavior for all other `<identifier>` blocks.
If `round` is set to `down` all other metrics will be evaluated using the round down behavior.
If an `<identifier>` has a key specified underneath it it will override the value in the `defaults` block.
For instance, `round: up` under `tensorflow:loss` will override the `round: down` behavior in the `defaults` block.

### `<range>`

Ranges can appear in the following forms:

1. `<number>` or `<number>..` this form allows you to specify that the metric must be greater than `<number>`.
3. `..<number>` this form allows you to specify that the metric must be less than `<number>`.
4. `<left>..<right>` this form allows you to specify that the metric must be less than `<left>` but greater than `<right>`.

Note these numbers are parsed as floats and relying on precise equality with the ends of the range is not recommended.

### Required Properties

* `target`: this is a `<range>` for the metric to appear in
* `aggregate`: this is the aggregating function to evaluate the metric by.
  * Currently this is only supported for the aggregates automatically generated by tensorflow, these values are:
    * `mean`
    * `stddev`
    * `max`
    * `min`
    * `var`
    * `median`

### Optional Properties

* `precision`: how many decimal places to keep (default 2)
* `round`: specifies rounding behavior (default “down”)
* `only-pulls`: only perform this check on pull requests
* `if-not-found`: return a default status if job has no data for `<identifier>`, defaults to “failure”
* `comment-on-pr`: include this metric in a summary content if the metrics were generated from a pull-request
