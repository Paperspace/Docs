# Experiments

## About

Experiments are the new unit of computation in Gradient Projects, intended to be use for intensive computational tasks like neural network training. Gradient supports single-node experiments as well as distributed training through multinode experiments.

## Single Node

## Multinode

Gradient utilizes gRPC to support distributed TensorFlow model training.
