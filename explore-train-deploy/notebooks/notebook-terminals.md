# Notebook terminals

Terminals are useful for interacting with the underlying OS environment to perform a variety of tasks such as installing packages, organizing files, etc. To open a terminal, just click the terminals icon in the sidebar. 

You can create terminal sessions by clicking the plus icon at the bottom of the sidebar. To delete or rename a terminal, click the menu icon to the right of the terminal list item.
