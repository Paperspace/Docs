# Fork a Notebook

## Fork your Notebook

Forking is a great way to make a copy of your Notebook, to save a version of it that you may want to go back to in case you expect to make major changes. Forking a notebook creates a new history for your notebook. The files copied to your notebook are those listed in your [notebook include file](https://github.com/Paperspace/Docs/blob/master/notebooks/create-a-notebook/notebook-include.md). This can copy notebooks, including public notebooks, into a team.

You will see an exact copy of your notebook appear at the top of your Notebooks list.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="CLI" %}
After the fork there will be a stopped notebook created in your team. You must call `gradient notebooks start --id ID` to run it.

### Usage

```bash
gradient notebooks fork [OPTIONS]
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
