# Notebook Kernel

### Default Kernel

By default, all .ipynb files are run on a python3 kernel with a number of preinstalled packages depending on the [runtime](../notebook-containers.md) you choose. This is meant to provide an environment that works right out of the box for the majority of projects.

### Kernel Health

Each time you create, upload or run a .ipynb file, a new kernel is created to manage that file. You can tell whether the kernel is running or not by the green icon next to the file.&#x20;

### Kernel Management

If you want to stop or restart a kernel you can do that within the sub-menu of the .ipynb file or from the restart kernel option in the top right of the IDE.

Additionally, users can stop all kernels in the top menu of the IDE.
