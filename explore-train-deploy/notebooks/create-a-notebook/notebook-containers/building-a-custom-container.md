# Building a Custom Container

## About

The Custom Containers feature lets you pull your own image from a container registry e.g., Docker Hub. This section will help you prepare a custom Docker container and show you how to bring that Container into Gradient by creating either a Notebook, Workflow, or Deployment with your custom container. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**ProTip!** Using a Custom Container does not require building one from scratch.  See this [article](./) for using one of the many freely available and up-to-date containers hosted on various container registries \(e.g., [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), [NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/landing) etc.\).
{% endhint %}

## Build a Custom Container Locally

#### 1. To get started, you’ll need:

* An Ubuntu computer with [DockerCE](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce), [NVIDIA-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker), and NVIDIA Drivers installed \(if you don’t have a Linux machine, use a Paperspace Linux VM!\).
* From that machine, you'll need to be logged into your [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account  `docker login -u <username> -p <password>`

#### 2. Add a Docker file to a working directory on your system

You can make your own file \(see Requirements below\) or use one like this example: [https://github.com/Paperspace/tensorflow-python](https://github.com/Paperspace/tensorflow-python)

#### 3. In the same directory:

* Run: `docker build -t <name of image>` For the example file above, you would enter: `docker build -t test-container`
* Tag the image so that it can be added to a repo with the image id, your Docker Hub username, and a name for the image:

`docker tag <image id> <dockerhub username>/test-container:latest`

#### 4. Push the image to Docker Hub with your username:

`docker push <username>/test-container:latest`

###  Requirements of Custom Notebooks

* Python
* Jupyter and all of Jupyter's dependencies must be installed:

[        http://jupyter.org/install](http://jupyter.org/install)

`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`

If you don't specify a user, your container user will be 'root'.

## Bringing your Custom Container to Gradient

After you've pushed your custom container to Docker Hub, NGC, etc., or you found a public container that is already there, it's time to pull it into Gradient!

### Notebooks  

Click the advanced options toggle on the notebook create a notebook page. Follow the rest of the steps [here](./#custom-containers) to create your Notebook by selecting your machine type, naming your notebook, and clicking Create. 

### Workflows

Just specify the path of the container e.g., `paperspace/gradient-sdk` from within a Workflow step using `image`. Learn more [here](../../../workflows/).

### Deployments

On the Choose Container step, navigate to the custom container tab and fill out the form. Note: A username and password must be provided for private Docker images.
