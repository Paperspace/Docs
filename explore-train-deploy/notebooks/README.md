# Notebooks

## What is a Notebook?

Gradient notebooks are an interactive environment for developing and running code. Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) are supported natively.  You can also treat a Notebook as a full IDE and both write and execute code written in other languages such as Python.  You can run Notebook on CPU or GPU instances.&#x20;

Within the Notebook, you can store an unlimited number of documents and other files. You can think of a Gradient Notebook as your persistent, on-demand workspace in the cloud.

## File Storage

Any data stored in `/storage` will be preserved for you across restarts. Persistent storage is backed by a filesystem and is ideal for storing data like images, datasets, model checkpoints, etc.  Learn more about persistent storage [here](../../more/overview/billing-and-subscriptions/notebooks-storage.md).

## Containers

Notebooks run within Docker containers behind the scenes. Gradient includes a handful of pre-built containers and you can easily use a custom container as well.  View the list of pre-built containers [here](create-a-notebook/notebook-containers/).

### Sharing Notebooks

You can easily generate a link to [share your Notebook](create-a-notebook/share-a-notebook.md) with friends and colleagues or the general public. Public Notebooks can be forked by others into their own account. To learn more about how Notebooks work, you can fork a public demo Notebook [here](https://console.paperspace.com/ps-dan/notebook/pr3k0bq87).  The [ML Showcase](https://ml-showcase.paperspace.com) **** includes several working examples of projects you can run with a couple clicks (project [submissions welcome](https://blog.paperspace.com/write-for-paperspace/)!)
