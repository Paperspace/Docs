# Model Path, Parameters, & Metadata

For an experiment to output a model in Gradient, the resulting model files need to be written to the specified or default model path.

## PS\_MODEL\_PATH

Using the PS\_MODEL\_PATH environment variable is the easiest way to make sure you are outputting to the correct location.

```python
model_dir = os.path.abspath(os.environ.get('PS_MODEL_PATH'))
#�You can also use gradient_sdk:
from gradient_sdk.utils import model_dir
```

## Default paths

**Singlenode**: `--modelPath /artifacts` is currently the default for singlenode experiments. Output your model files there to appear in your Model Repository so that you can deploy it using Deployments

**Multinode:** The default model path for multinode experiments is `/storage/models/<experiment_id>/`

{% hint style="info" %}
In Gradient Enterprise environments, the default model path will be `/shared/models/<experiment_id>`

SaaS users should specify `--modelPath /artifacts` in order to be able to deploy that model via Gradient.
{% endhint %}

## Model Parameters

To store Models in the Models list, add the following Model-specific parameters to the Experiment command when running an Experiment.

#### Model Type

`--modelType` defines the type of model that is being generated by the experiment. For example, `--modelType Tensorflow` will ensure that the model checkpoint files being generated are recognized as Tensorflow model files.

| Model Type Values | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `"Tensorflow"` | Tensorflow compatible model outputs |
| `"ONNX"` | ONNX model outputs |
| `"Custom"` | Custom model type \(e.g., a simple flask server\) |

#### Model Path

`--modelPath` defines where in the context of an Experiment the Model checkpoint files will be stored. This is a key argument that enables the evaluation and persistence of the generated model files.

One option is to set `--modelPath "/artifacts"` and keep the checkpoint files around only in the context of its Experiment. Another option is to set `--modelPath "/storage/models"` to have permanent access to the model generated files in  your Paperspace storage.

**Enabling Support for Models with GradientCI**

You can also specify the model path and model type parameters when running experiments with GradientCI . See [GradientCI Models](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/projects/gradientci#models) for more info.

## Custom model metadata

When `modelType` is not specified, custom model metadata can be associated with the model for later reference by creating a **gradient-model-metadata.json** file in the `modelPath` directory. Any valid JSON data can be stored in this file.

For models of type `Tensorflow`, metadata is automatically generated for your experiment, so any custom model metadata will be ignored.

An example of custom model metadata JSON is as follows:

```javascript
{
  "metrics": [
    {
      "name": "accuracy-score",  
      "numberValue": 60
    }
  ]
}
```
